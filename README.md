**CI/CD Red Team Framework**

> Like Metasploit, but for CI/CD pipelines.

*From the makers of the [poutine](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine) Build Pipeline SAST scanner at [BoostSecurity Labs](https://labs.boostsecurity.io).*

---

> **Warning: This tool is for authorized security testing only.**
>
> SmokedMeat exists because CI/CD pipeline threats are deeply underestimated. Traditional security training rarely covers supply chain attacks, leaving defenders unprepared for techniques that adversaries actively exploit in the wild.
>
> We built this to give security teams the ability to learn, practice, and validate defenses against advanced CI/CD attack techniques through realistic red team exercises.

## What is SmokedMeat?

SmokedMeat is a post-exploitation framework for CI/CD pipelines. Point it at a GitHub organization, let it find vulnerable workflows, deploy an implant to a compromised runner, then pivot through cloud providers, extract secrets, and map the blast radius  - all from a terminal UI.

**What it does:**

1. **Analyze**  - Scan an org's GitHub Actions workflows for injection vulnerabilities, dangerous triggers, and unsafe checkout patterns (powered by [poutine](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine))
2. **Exploit**  - Deploy a stager via PR, issue, comment, or workflow dispatch. When the vulnerable workflow runs, it downloads and executes the implant on the CI runner.
3. **Post-exploit**  - Extract secrets from runner memory, enumerate GitHub token permissions, scan for private keys, and collect loot
4. **Pivot**  - Use captured credentials to move laterally: discover private repos, mint GitHub App tokens, exchange OIDC tokens for AWS/GCP/Azure access, probe SSH deploy keys

**Philosophy:** Bold and noisy. This isn't an EDR evasion tool. It's a demonstration framework that shows how deep a CI/CD compromise goes before anything triggers an alert.

**Who is it for:**
- Red teams validating CI/CD security posture in enterprise environments
- Pentesters demonstrating supply chain attack paths to stakeholders
- Security engineers testing detection and response for pipeline attacks
- Researchers developing new CI/CD exploitation techniques
- Bug bounty hunters exploring supply chain attack surface

## Quick Start

Try SmokedMeat from source with Docker, Go 1.25+, and `make`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boostsecurityio/smokedmeat.git
cd smokedmeat
make dev-quickstart
```

This builds the `smokedmeat-cloud-shell` image, starts the quickstart infrastructure in Docker, and launches Counter locally via `go run ./cmd/counter`. If the quickstart stack is already healthy, rerunning `make dev-quickstart` reuses the existing tunnel and NATS, refreshes Kitchen, and jumps straight back into Counter:

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **cloudflared** | Creates a temporary Cloudflare tunnel so GitHub runners can reach your Kitchen over HTTPS  - no domain or DNS setup needed |
| **nats** | NATS JetStream message bus for Kitchen-to-implant communication |
| **kitchen** | C2 teamserver (HTTP API + WebSocket) with shared-token auth and embedded Brisket binaries |
| **smokedmeat-cloud-shell** | Docker runtime for `cloud shell` and `ssh shell` when Counter runs locally |

The setup wizard walks you through:
1. **GitHub PAT**  - A classic PAT with `public_repo` scope is enough to try it against the `whooli` test org. For private repos, you'll need `repo` scope.
2. **Target**  - Enter `whooli` (our public CI/CD attack playground) or your own org/repo
3. **Analysis**  - Scans workflows for vulnerabilities and presents exploitable findings

When done:
```bash
make dev-quickstart-down   # Stop containers
make dev-quickstart-purge  # Stop and delete all data
```

`make quickstart` now targets an explicitly pinned released version instead of following the newest tag automatically. That keeps quickstart stable and breaks the recursion between "just published" and "good enough to pin". Use `make quickstart-version` to inspect the current pin. Maintainers advance it with `make quickstart-pin VERSION=v0.0.1-rc1`, which verifies the immutable GitHub release, records the published Counter asset digests, and pins the signed Kitchen and `smokedmeat-cloud-shell` image digests before updating `configs/quickstart-release.mk`. The first release-backed path is expected to embed only `brisket-linux-amd64` in Kitchen, so quickstart releases will initially target Linux x86_64 runners for agent delivery.

### Dev Quickstart Notes

| Feature | `make dev-quickstart` |
|---------|-----------------------|
| Clipboard (copy payloads) | Works on the host |
| Open browser links | Opens directly on the host |
| Cloud shell (gcloud, aws, az) | Uses the `smokedmeat-cloud-shell` Docker image that `make dev-quickstart` prebuilds |
| Tunnel URL | Random, changes on restart |
| Auth | Shared token |

If you want to start the infrastructure first and launch Counter later:

```bash
# Start just the infrastructure in Docker
make dev-quickstart-up

# Launch Counter with the quickstart token and Kitchen URLs
make dev-quickstart-counter
```

## Deployment Modes

### Development Quickstart (Local Evaluation)

`make dev-quickstart` is the current fastest path from source. It uses Docker for cloudflared, NATS, and Kitchen, shared-token auth, local `go run ./cmd/counter`, and a prebuilt `smokedmeat-cloud-shell:latest` image for `cloud shell` and `ssh shell`. When the stack is already healthy, rerunning it keeps the existing tunnel and NATS but refreshes Kitchen before launching Counter again.

### Quickstart (Release-backed)

`make quickstart` uses the pinned release in `configs/quickstart-release.mk`. It verifies the cached Counter archive against the pinned GitHub release digest, runs Docker with the pinned Kitchen image digest, and overrides compiled Counter to use the pinned `smokedmeat-cloud-shell` image digest.

This means quickstart can intentionally stay one version behind the newest release until that release has been validated. Maintainers update the pin with `make quickstart-pin VERSION=v...`, inspect it with `make quickstart-version`, and then use `make quickstart`. `make quickstart-pin` requires `gh`, `cosign`, and `docker` in `PATH`.

### Self-Hosted (Engagements)

For a real red team engagement, deploy Kitchen on a dedicated host with a stable domain. Stager callbacks from compromised CI runners will land on this host, so it needs a routable IP and DNS.

This mode uses:
- **Caddy** reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt TLS
- **SSH challenge-response auth**  - each operator authenticates with their SSH key, giving per-operator audit trails
- **Docker Compose** for Kitchen + NATS
- Counter runs **natively** on each operator's workstation

See the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for setup instructions.

## Try It on a Vulnerable Target

The [`whooli`](docs/WHOOLI.md) GitHub organization is a deliberately vulnerable CI/CD attack playground  - think Juice Shop for pipelines. It has planted vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, cache poisoning chains, and OIDC federation to a GCP bucket with a flag.

Start with `make dev-quickstart`, enter `whooli` as your target, and see how far you get. The [challenge guide](docs/WHOOLI.md) explains the setup without giving away the solutions.
