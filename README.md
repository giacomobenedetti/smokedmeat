**CI/CD Red Team Framework**

> Like Metasploit, but for CI/CD pipelines.

*From the makers of the [poutine](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine) Build Pipeline SAST scanner at [BoostSecurity Labs](https://labs.boostsecurity.io).*

---

> **Warning: This tool is for authorized security testing only.**
>
> SmokedMeat exists because CI/CD pipeline threats are deeply underestimated. Traditional security training rarely covers supply chain attacks, leaving defenders unprepared for techniques that adversaries actively exploit in the wild.
>
> We built this to give security teams the ability to learn, practice, and validate defenses against advanced CI/CD attack techniques through realistic red team exercises.
>
> **Only use against systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.**

## What is SmokedMeat?

SmokedMeat is a post-exploitation framework for CI/CD pipelines. Point it at a GitHub organization, let it find vulnerable workflows, deploy an implant to a compromised runner, then pivot through cloud providers, extract secrets, and map the blast radius  - all from a terminal UI.

**What it does:**

1. **Analyze**  - Scan an org's GitHub Actions workflows for injection vulnerabilities, dangerous triggers, and unsafe checkout patterns (powered by [poutine](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine))
2. **Exploit**  - Deploy a stager via PR, issue, comment, or workflow dispatch. When the vulnerable workflow runs, it downloads and executes the implant on the CI runner.
3. **Post-exploit**  - Extract secrets from runner memory, enumerate GitHub token permissions, scan for private keys, and collect loot
4. **Pivot**  - Use captured credentials to move laterally: discover private repos, mint GitHub App tokens, exchange OIDC tokens for AWS/GCP/Azure access, probe SSH deploy keys

**Philosophy:** Bold and noisy. This isn't an EDR evasion tool. It's a demonstration framework that shows how deep a CI/CD compromise goes before anything triggers an alert.

**Who is it for:**
- Red teams validating CI/CD security posture in enterprise environments
- Pentesters demonstrating supply chain attack paths to stakeholders
- Security engineers testing detection and response for pipeline attacks
- Researchers developing new CI/CD exploitation techniques
- Bug bounty hunters exploring supply chain attack surface

## Quick Start

Need Docker and `make`. If you want to run from source instead of the pinned release path, also install Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boostsecurityio/smokedmeat.git
cd smokedmeat
make quickstart
# Then use a classic PAT with public_repo and target the whooli GitHub org.
```

`make quickstart` is the recommended first run. It starts the stable release quickstart stack locally and launches the operator TUI (`Counter`) against the local C2 teamserver (`Kitchen`).

The setup wizard walks you through:
1. **GitHub PAT**  - A classic PAT with `public_repo` scope is enough for `whooli`. For private repos, you'll need `repo` scope.
2. **Target**  - Enter `whooli` or your own org/repo
3. **Analysis**  - Scans workflows for vulnerabilities and presents exploitable findings

For the full challenge flow, see the [`whooli` guide](docs/WHOOLI.md) or go straight to the [`whooli` GitHub org](https://github.com/whooli).

When you are done:
```bash
make quickstart-down       # Stop containers
make quickstart-purge      # Stop and delete all data
```

Working from source instead:

```bash
make dev-quickstart
```

`make dev-quickstart` builds the local `smokedmeat-cloud-shell` image, starts `cloudflared`, `nats`, and the C2 teamserver (`Kitchen`), then launches the operator TUI from source.

If you want the infrastructure first and the operator TUI later:

```bash
make dev-quickstart-up
make dev-quickstart-counter
```

When you are done:
```bash
make dev-quickstart-down   # Stop containers
make dev-quickstart-purge  # Stop and delete all data
```

## Core Components

| Standard term | SmokedMeat name | Description |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Operator TUI** | `Counter` | Terminal interface for analysis, payload delivery, and post-exploitation workflow. |
| **C2 teamserver** | `Kitchen` | API and WebSocket server for operator sessions, stagers, callbacks, and graph state. |
| **Implant** | `Brisket` | Agent delivered to compromised CI runners for beaconing, command execution, and pivoting. |
| **Browser graph view** | `Browser View` | Live attack graph served by the C2 teamserver at `/graph`. |

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Use it when | Entry point |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Quickstart** | Fastest first run on the pinned release | `make quickstart` |
| **Dev Quickstart** | Working on the source tree locally | `make dev-quickstart` |
| **Hosted Teamserver** | Running a real engagement with a stable domain | [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) |

Hosted Teamserver runs the C2 teamserver on a dedicated host and the operator TUI natively on each operator workstation.

## Architecture

At a high level, the operator TUI (`Counter`) talks to the C2 teamserver (`Kitchen`), which manages implants (`Brisket`) running on compromised CI runners and serves the live attack graph.

## Try It on a Vulnerable Target

The [`whooli`](docs/WHOOLI.md) GitHub organization is a deliberately vulnerable CI/CD attack playground  - think Juice Shop for pipelines. It has planted vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, cache poisoning chains, and OIDC federation to a GCP bucket with a flag.

Start with `make dev-quickstart`, enter `whooli` as your target, and see how far you get. The [challenge guide](docs/WHOOLI.md) explains the setup without giving away the solutions.
